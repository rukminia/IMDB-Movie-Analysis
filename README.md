# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
Problem Statement: The dataset i worked with is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.

Data Analysis: Here,exploring the data to understand the relationships between different variables is done. You might look at the correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc by considering the year of release, the actors involved, and other relevant factors.

Five 'Whys' Approach: This technique helped me dig deeper into the problem. For instance, if you find that movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings, you can ask "Why?" repeatedly to uncover the root cause. Here's an example:

Q: "Why do movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings?"

Q: "Why are viewers more likely to rate a movie highly if they enjoyed watching it?"
